# lke-saif-site
Deploy a site using the LKE cluster as a follow up from the [terraform-k8s-linode](https://github.com/Saifalkayali/terraform-k8s-linode/tree/main#terraform-k8s-linode) Github Repositry README.md sections. A container for a static site can be written simply which makes the site easy to deploy as a demo. 

### Steps to build the image and deploy the site can be found here:
